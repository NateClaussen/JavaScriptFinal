                            Hello! My Name is Nate Claussen. As a student at Ogden Weber Technical College, I am in their software development program and am loving every second of it! Through my senior year of High school, I completed the pre-requisite Software Technology Course,
                            and post-graduation have continued my learnings. I expect to graduate in June 2021 and am really excited!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love to play games of all sorts and spend time with my family. In my free time, you might find me reading a book or spending time with my friends. I could also be playing my trombone, or simply making race car noises or explosions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been to a total of 11 different schools (including pre-school and college)! Almost one for every grade! I've lived in three different states; Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. I always get asked the question on which place I like the best, but I have
                            not been able to come up with one that is the best. All of the places I've lived have just been too good :).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the random things that I can do is drink a 16.9 fl oz water bottle in less than a second. One day I saw a video of someone doing it on youtube, and thought to myself, "I can do that! That sounds easy!" Ever since that day, I have practiced and
                            practiced and gotten my time to what I like to think is close to the world record <span id="easterEgg1">ðŸ˜‚</span>
                        </p>
